  description:
    "The dwarf planets in the H.O.T digital twin: a mini-orrery of Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris on their real, eccentric, radius-compressed orbits, with Neptune's orbit as the trans-Neptunian reference and Pluto's 3:2 Neptune resonance. Click-to-focus detail globes with computed day/night terminators — real New Horizons/Dawn maps for Pluto, Charon and Ceres; clearly-labelled illustrative spheres for the never-visited Eris, Haumea and Makemake (Haumea rendered as its real triaxial ellipsoid with its real ring). Dwarf planets have no weather — the honest substance is orbital mechanics, measured facts and real textures where they exist.",
