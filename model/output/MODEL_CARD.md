# TerraScope Baseline Temperature Forecast — Model Card

## What this is
A set of deliberately simple, transparent baseline models that predict 2 m air
temperature 24/48/72 hours ahead for 20 cities, validated on a strict temporal
holdout. It exists to give the H.O.T digital twin an honest, reproducible,
browser-runnable forecast layer — **it is a baseline for transparency and
education, NOT a competitor to national weather services or to Open-Meteo/GFS
forecasts.** Real NWP models are far more accurate; any forecast shown from
this model must be labeled "H.O.T baseline model".

## Models
1. **Persistence** — T(t+L) = T(t). The reference baseline for skill scores.
2. **Climatology** — mean temperature for that hour-of-day and day-of-year
   (±7-day window), computed from training years only.
3. **Ridge regression** (per city, per lead) — closed-form ridge on 19
   standardized physics-informed features: current/lagged temperature,
   climatology anomaly, pressure + 3 h pressure tendency, humidity, cloud
   cover, wind components, advection proxies (wind × anomaly), hour/season
   sin-cos encodings, and a solar-elevation proxy at issue and target time.
   Lambda chosen per city/lead on a 2024 validation split, refit on 2020-2024.

## Data
- Source: ERA5 reanalysis via the Open-Meteo archive API (hourly).
- Cities: 20 across tropical/arid/temperate/continental/polar zones,
  both hemispheres.
- Train: 2020-01-01 .. 2024-12-31. Test: 2025-01-01 .. 2025-12-31 (strict temporal holdout).
- Climatology and feature scalers computed from the train period only;
  no test-period information enters any model (no leakage).
- Ridge numbers below are computed FROM the exported `coefficients.json`
  using the documented inference recipe, so they are fully reproducible. The
  coefficients are exported for offline/in-browser inference; the web app
  currently displays Open-Meteo forecasts (labeled as such) rather than running
  this per-city baseline live.

## Limitations (read before using)
- **Not an operational forecast.** No atmospheric dynamics, no spatial fields,
  no ensemble. A single-point statistical model cannot see approaching weather
  systems; its skill over climatology comes mostly from local persistence and
  the seasonal/diurnal cycle.
- Verified against ERA5 reanalysis, not station observations; ERA5 itself has
  errors, especially in complex terrain (e.g. Denver) and data-sparse regions.
- One grid point per city; coastal/urban microclimates are not resolved.
- Trained on 2020-2024; performance may degrade under climate drift or
  conditions outside the training distribution.
- Skill decays with lead time; at t+72 h the ridge is only modestly better
  than climatology in many cities.
- Error bars for display should come from the validation residuals in
  `accuracy.json` (per city, per lead), not be invented.
