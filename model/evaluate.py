"""Evaluate persistence, climatology, and ridge models on the 2025 holdout.

Honesty guarantees:
- test = issue times in 2025 only; train/test split is strictly temporal
- the ridge is evaluated FROM the exported output/coefficients.json artifact
  (same weights, scaler, and compact climatology a browser would use), so the
  reported numbers are exactly what in-browser inference achieves
- the climatology baseline is the full hourly (doy x hour, +/-7 day window)
  table computed from TRAIN years only
- all three models are scored on the identical sample set per city/lead

Writes model/output/accuracy.json and model/output/MODEL_CARD.md.

Usage: python evaluate.py
