            seven major moons (Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan,

            plane, so they only cross in front of the disk (transit), pass behind it
            (occultation) or cast a shadow on the cloud tops (shadow transit) during

            <span className="text-ice">unresolvable from Earth</span> (Pluto&apos;s
            disk is only about 0.1 arcsec across, the moons far fainter), so nothing

            exception was the Pluto-Charon mutual events, visible in 1985-1990 when
            the orbit was edge-on and again around 2103, which fall straight out of
            the geometry. Second, the data splits into{" "}

          <p className="mt-2">
            The Sun tab had the source and the Earth tabs had the sky, with
            nothing joining them. The aurora is that join. Four NOAA SWPC feeds,
            live and keyless: the planetary Kp index, the 3-day outlook, the
            solar wind from DSCOVR at L1, and OVATION Prime, NOAA&apos;s own
            aurora model, drawn on the globe at the real 110 km emission
            altitude.

              number.
            </span>{" "}
            Aurora rings the GEOMAGNETIC pole, which currently sits in the
            Canadian Arctic, not the top of the globe. Edinburgh and Moscow share
            a geographic latitude to within a fifth of a degree and are more than
            six degrees apart geomagnetically, which is the entire reason
            Scotland has aurora luck Moscow does not. lib/aurora computes
            centred-dipole geomagnetic coordinates from the IGRF-13 pole, and the
            tab shows both numbers side by side.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            It also answers a question most space-weather sites skip: an observer
            south of the oval can still see it, because the emission is
            kilometres up and clears their horizon from far away. That is real
            geometry, d = R&nbsp;acos(R/(R+h)), and it separates cleanly: green at
            110 km reaches about 1,175 km, the red emission at 300 km reaches
            about 1,960 km, roughly seven degrees of latitude further. That
            difference is why a severe storm produces red glows reported from
            places the oval never came near. And because a bright oval over a sky
            that never darkens is not an aurora anyone sees, the tab borrows the
            Tonight calculation to check whether it is even dark where you are.

            aurora products by up to eight degrees at high Kp. Two tabs quietly
            disagreeing about where the aurora reaches is exactly what this
            project exists not to do, so lib/sun now delegates to lib/aurora and
            there is one model. The table also decomposes better: the boundary
            can mean just the boundary, because the horizon reach is computed
            separately instead of being folded into it.

            regional networks with different detection thresholds glued together,
            so no single completeness magnitude makes it complete and every

            The tide-raising force is a DIFFERENCE in gravity across the Earth

            The theory predicts about half a metre of range everywhere. Eastport,

            Every other tab is built around a <em>thing</em>. The Tonight tab is
            built around a <em>place and a moment</em>, which is the question a
            person actually has when they step outside. It fetches{" "}
            <span className="text-ice">no new data</span> and composes four worlds
            that were already here: Sun geometry from lib/solar, the Moon from

            out of the same code and are reported as named states rather than
            missing data: <em>midnight sun</em>, <em>polar night</em>, and{" "}
            <em>no astronomical darkness</em> for the mid-summer band above about
            48.5 degrees. lib/tonight carries 56 unit tests against published
            values, including June-solstice day length for London, Boston and
            Sydney, the 28 and 47 degree elongation caps that keep Mercury and

            get, and it knows nothing about clouds, because this app ships no

            solid overcast where you are standing, and the page says so on screen.
            There is no light pollution model either, so no limiting magnitude is
            ever claimed. The darkness score prints its own two-term formula next
            to the number so it can be checked rather than trusted.

            Transits &mdash; the measurement behind the Exoplanets tab

          <p className="mt-2">
            The Transits tab shows <em>how we know</em>. When a planet crosses its
            star, the star dims by the ratio of their disc areas, and that dip is
            where most exoplanet radii come from. It adds{" "}
            <span className="text-ice">no new data</span>: it reads the NASA
            Exoplanet Archive subset already shipped for the Exoplanets tab and

            Depth gives Rp/Rs and nothing else, so a planet&apos;s absolute size
            inherits its star&apos;s radius error one-for-one (a test asserts that
            a 10% larger star yields a 10% larger planet), and depth says nothing
            about mass. Computed by lib/transits in 35 unit tests against textbook
            and published values: 84 ppm for Earth across the Sun, ~1.1% for
            Jupiter, 1.4% and 3.1 hours for HD 209458 b, 0.74% and 36 minutes for
            TRAPPIST-1 b. The three-number comparison showing why small cool stars

            Starlink alone is 10,873 tracked objects, which cannot all be
            propagated and drawn in a browser tab, so 1,500 are evenly sampled
            (every nth record, not the first 1,500). The true tracked count is
            stored per group and shown beside the drawn count, so the tab says
            &quot;1,500 of 10,873 drawn&quot; rather than putting 10,873 over a
            picture of 1,500. Every other group is complete, so the debris counts
            are exact. Element-set age is surfaced too: SGP4 error grows roughly
            1-3 km/day from epoch, and the tab states the expected along-track
            error in words instead of implying a precise position.

            the catalogue publishes no remnant spins at all, so the 291 Hz ringdown
            note is computed with a spin estimated from the mass ratio and is
