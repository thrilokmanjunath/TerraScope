 * ~18,000 REAL SDSS DR17 galaxy positions (measured RA/Dec/redshift), not a
 * procedural fake. What is COMPUTED is the RA/Dec + redshift to 3D-Mpc mapping,
 * done by lib/galaxies at the adopted H0 = 70. The radial axis is REDSHIFT-SPACE
 * (cz/H0), so clusters stretch radially into real "fingers of God"; the slice is
 * a thin equatorial wedge. Rendered galaxy-disk styling is illustrative/labeled.
