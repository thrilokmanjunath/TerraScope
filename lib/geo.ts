/**
 * Geographic <-> 3D coordinate conventions for the TerraScope globe.
 *
 * The globe is an unrotated three.js SphereGeometry. Three.js generates
 * sphere vertices as:
 *
 *   x = -r * cos(phi) * sin(theta)
 *   y =  r * cos(theta)
 *   z =  r * sin(phi) * sin(theta)
 *
 * with texture u = phi / 2PI and v running north -> south. For a standard
 * equirectangular Earth texture (u = (lon + 180) / 360, v = (90 - lat) / 180)
 * this works out to the following Earth-fixed frame:
 *
 *   lon   0  (Greenwich)  -> +X
 *   lon +90 (East)        -> -Z
 *   lon -90 (West)        -> +Z
 *   lat +90 (North pole)  -> +Y
 *
 * Everything that converts between lat/lon and 3D (picking, sun direction,
 * markers) MUST go through these two functions so the convention lives in
 * exactly one place. Verified against known cities in lib/geo.test.ts.
