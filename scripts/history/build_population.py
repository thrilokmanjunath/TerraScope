"""Build public/data/history/population.json for the "time-machine Earth" layer.

World population over time, driving the Virtual Earth HUD's global population
counter that climbs with the timeline.

Source:
    Our World in Data — "Population".
    Grapher CSV:      https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population.csv
    Grapher page:     https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population
    OWID's own processing is licensed CC BY 4.0. The underlying series are
    HYDE (2023, CC BY 4.0), Gapminder (2022, CC BY 4.0) and the UN World
    Population Prospects (2024). The chain is cleanly redistributable with
    attribution (verified 2026-07-06; see docs/HISTORY_DATA_SOURCES.md §2b).

Attribution (must also appear in the app credits):
    "Population — HYDE (2023); Gapminder (2022); UN WPP (2024) — with major
     processing by Our World in Data (CC BY 4.0)."

Input format (verified): CSV with columns `Entity, Code, Year, Population`,
covering -10000 (10,000 BCE) -> present, with an `Entity == "World"` row for
the global total.

Output (compact): the exact shape lib/chrono-population.ts expects,
    [ [year, population], [year, population], ... ]   (year CE, negative = BCE)
sorted ascending by year. We keep the World series and DOWNSAMPLE it to a
sensible set of years (dense recent, sparse ancient) so the file stays tiny
(<50 KB) while remaining faithful to the source — every value shipped is an
actual OWID data point (nearest available year), never interpolated.

Usage:
    python scripts/history/build_population.py            # download + build
    python scripts/history/build_population.py --local FILE  # use a pre-downloaded population.csv

No third-party dependencies (stdlib only): urllib + csv + json.
