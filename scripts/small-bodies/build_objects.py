"""Build public/data/small-bodies/objects.json -- curated REAL comets and
near-Earth / notable asteroids for the small-bodies phase (Phase 9).

Every orbital / physical value in the output is a MEASURED, published quantity
fetched live from NASA/JPL's Small-Body Database (SBDB) API, and every
close-approach fact is fetched live from JPL/CNEOS's Close-Approach Data (CAD)
API. Nothing orbital/physical is invented or interpolated: where SBDB has no
value we emit JSON null.

The ONLY curated (hand-transcribed, not-from-SBDB) per-object fields are:
  * visited (bool) + mission (str)   -- historical spacecraft record
  * interstellar (bool)              -- physics fact, TRUE only for 1I and 2I
  * note (str)                       -- short honest human summary
These are well-established public facts, flagged as curated in meta.honesty.
Everything else -- name, designation, kind, class, pha, neo, the orbital
elements, and the physical parameters -- comes straight from SBDB.

SOURCES (verified live 2026-07-10)
  * JPL Small-Body Database (SBDB) API, version 1.3 (2021 Sep):
      https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.api?sstr=<desig>&phys-par=true&full-prec=true
    Returns object identity + flags (fullname, des, kind, orbit_class, pha,
    neo, spkid), osculating orbital ELEMENTS and orbit metadata, and PHYSICAL
    parameters. One body per call.
  * JPL/CNEOS Close-Approach Data (CAD) API, version 1.5 (2023 Mar):
      https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/cad.api?date-min=..&date-max=..&dist-max=..&fullname=true&sort=dist
    Returns real close approaches to Earth (des, cd calendar date TDB, dist in
    au, v_rel/v_inf in km/s, h magnitude, fullname).

SBDB ORBITAL ELEMENTS returned (name / units, verified live 2026-07-10):
    e   eccentricity                         [dimensionless]
    a   semi-major axis                      [au]   (NEGATIVE for hyperbolic)
    q   perihelion distance                  [au]
    ad  aphelion distance                    [au]   (null for e >= 1)
    i   inclination to ecliptic              [deg]
    om  longitude of ascending node          [deg]
    w   argument of perihelion               [deg]
    ma  mean anomaly                         [deg]
    tp  time of perihelion passage           [JD, TDB]
    per sidereal orbital period              [days] (null for e >= 1)
    n   mean motion                          [deg/day]
  orbit metadata also used: epoch [JD TDB], soln_date, moid [au, Earth MOID],
    t_jup [Tisserand parameter wrt Jupiter], orbit_class {code,name}.

SBDB PHYSICAL parameters returned (name / units, verified live 2026-07-10):
    H         absolute magnitude             [mag]  (asteroids; comets use M1)
    diameter  diameter                       [km]
    rot_per   sidereal rotation period       [h]
    albedo    geometric albedo               [dimensionless]
    spec_T    Tholen spectral type           / spec_B  SMASSII spectral type
    M1        comet total absolute magnitude [mag]  (comets)
  Nulls are emitted wherever SBDB has no value for a body (never filled in).

CLASSIFICATION comes from SBDB's own orbit_class -- authoritative, not guessed:
    Asteroids: APO Apollo / ATE Aten / AMO Amor / IEO Atira (Interior-Earth) /
               MBA Main-belt / MCA Mars-crossing / etc.
    Comets:    JFc Jupiter-family / HTC Halley-type / ETc Encke-type /
               COM long-period / HYP hyperbolic comet / HYA hyperbolic asteroid.
    pha (Potentially Hazardous Asteroid) is SBDB's boolean flag
    (defined: Earth MOID < 0.05 au AND H <= 22.0). We do NOT recompute it.

HAZARD HONESTY (per the phase brief): close approaches and PHA status are REAL
and stated with real numbers, neither sensationalized nor downplayed. Apophis's
2029-04-13 pass is a real ~0.099-lunar-distance (geocentric ~38,000 km / ~31,600
km above the surface) close approach, naked-eye visible; the impact risk for
2029/2036/2068 was RULED OUT (NASA removed Apophis from the risk list in 2021).

INTERSTELLAR vs merely-HYPERBOLIC (a real distinction, not a shortcut): SBDB's
HYP/HYA classes contain BOTH the two genuinely interstellar visitors (1I, 2I)
AND ordinary near-parabolic Oort-cloud comets whose osculating eccentricity is
marginally > 1 (e.g. C/2023 A3 with e~1.0001, C/2012 S1 ISON). e > 1 alone does
NOT mean interstellar. We therefore set interstellar=True ONLY for 1I/'Oumuamua
and 2I/Borisov (unbound origin, large hyperbolic excess velocity), and add a
hyperbolic flag (from e >= 1 / null period) to every unbound osculating orbit.
